# Robot Pathfinding Simulation
This project simulates a robot moving through a grid using the A* pathfinding algorithm. The robot
starts at a specified position and must find its way to a goal position while avoiding obstacles. The
simulation also includes checkpoints along the way to demonstrate dynamic pathfinding.
## Features:
- A grid-based environment where obstacles are randomly placed.
- A* Pathfinding algorithm used to calculate the shortest path from the start to the goal.
- Checkpoints are included along the path for demonstration.
- Visualization of the robot's movement from start to goal.
- Grid visualization with obstacles, start, goal, and checkpoints displayed in different colors.
## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (for graphics and simulation)
To install Pygame, run:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
## File Structure:
- `main.py`: The main simulation file that runs the Pygame window, handles user interaction, and
integrates all components of the project.
- `grid.py`: Contains functions for drawing the grid, obstacles, and path.
- `pathfinding.py`: Implements the A* pathfinding algorithm to calculate the robot's path from start to
goal.
- `constants.py`: Defines constants for grid dimensions, colors, and other configurations.

## Setup:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
3. Install the necessary libraries (Pygame).
4. Run `main.py` to start the simulation.
## How It Works:
- The robot will move along the path generated by the A* algorithm from the starting point to the
goal.
- Obstacles are dynamically added to the grid to block the robot's movement.
- The robot's path is recalculated to avoid obstacles and reach the goal.
### A* Pathfinding:
The A* algorithm works by evaluating possible paths based on two factors:
- **G-score**: The distance from the starting point.
- **F-score**: The estimated total distance to the goal based on the current position.
The robot moves along the path with the lowest F-score until it reaches the goal or determines no
path is available.

## How to Run the Project:
1. Navigate to the project folder.
2. Run the following command in your terminal/command prompt:
```bash
python main.py
```
## Customization:
You can modify the following in `constants.py`:
- `cols`, `rows`: Adjust the size of the grid.
- `obstacles`: Add or remove obstacles to create different challenges for the robot.
- `checkpoints`: Add checkpoints along the path to test multi-stage pathfinding.
